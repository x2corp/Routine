## Routine: a rhythm-game focused Discord bot

Routine is a bot designed for quick statistic referencing and fetching using direct API calls.  
Currently, it's focused around Rhythia and osu!, but I'm planning to add more features as time goes.

## Setup
A [!config file(https://github.com/x2corp/Routine/blob/main/source/glob/config-example.yml)] is located in source/glob.  
Locate a Rhythia session token by logging in to the [!Rhythia website(https://rhythia.com)], and then fetching it from a POST request.
Other than that, running the Routine.py file will do all the work for you.

## Routine: a rhythm-game focused Discord bot

Routine is a bot designed for quick statistic referencing and fetching using direct API calls.  
Currently, it's focused around Rhythia and osu!, but I'm planning to add more features as time goes.

## Setup
A [config file](https://github.com/x2corp/Routine/blob/main/source/glob/config-example.yml) is located in source/glob.  
To locate your Rhythia session token, log in to the [Rhythia website](https://rhythia.com). You can then fetch it from any POST request made to the site's API.  
After that, running the Routine.py file in the root directory will do the rest of the work for you.
